# Nvidia-Autopilot-TensorFlow
A TensorFlow implementation of this [Nvidia paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) with some changes.

## How to Use
Use `python train.py` to train the model

Use `python run.py` to run the model on a live webcam feed

Use `python run_dataset.py` to run the model on the dataset

## Download Dataset 
  Download a [Udacity Dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car) and extract into a (new) $REPO_ROOT/dataset folder

## Extration
  Use [Udacity ROS Reader](https://github.com/rwightman/udacity-driving-reader) repository to extract the dataset using Docker containers.
